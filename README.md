# Test Plan
##	Introduction
The test plan is intended to outline the approach for testing the application hosted at Timely Froyo. This web application likely serves as a front-end platform for an online service or product (possibly related to frozen yogurt). The plan details how the software testing will be structured to ensure it meets the requirements and works as expected. This test plan outlines the software testing approach for the product page of the demo website. The primary goal is to ensure the page's functionality, performance, security, and usability meet the required standards. This test plan will help identify potential issues before the product page is deployed to production.
